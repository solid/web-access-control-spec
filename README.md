# Web Access Control (WAC)
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-Solid-7C4DFF.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/solid/solid)

Web Access Control (WAC) specification (as used by the Solid project). It
is based on Tim Berners-Lee's May 2009 proposal, as originally captured, and
subsequently evolved by the community, at
[Web Access Control Wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl). This spec
is a particular subset of the options and extensions described in the wiki.

For use with [LDP](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) (and [LDP
Next](https://www.w3.org/community/ldpnext/)) type systems, such as the
[Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid) project (see also the parent
[spec](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec)).

**Current Spec version:** `v.0.5.0` (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md))

## Overview

Web Access Control (WAC) is a decentralized cross-domain access control system.
The main concepts should be familiar to developers, as they are similar to
access control schemes used in many file systems. It's concerned with giving
access to agents (users, groups and more) to perform various kinds of operations
(read, write, append, etc) on resources. WAC has several key features:

1. The resources are identified by URLs, and can refer to any web documents or
  resources.
2. It is *declarative* -- access control policies live in regular web documents,
  which can be exported/backed easily, using the same mechanism as you would
  for backing up the rest of your data.
3. Users and groups are also identified by URLs (specifically, by
  [WebIDs](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec#identity))
4. It is *cross-domain* -- all of its components, such as resources, agent
  WebIDs, and even the documents containing the access control policies, can
  potentially reside on separate domains. In other words, you can give access
  to a resource on one site to users and groups hosted on another site.

## Access Control List Resources

In a system that uses Web Access Control, each web resource has a set of
*Authorization* statements describing:

1. Who has access to that resource (that is, who the authorized *agents* are)
2. What types (or *modes*) of access they have

These Authorizations are either explicitly set for an individual resource, or
(more often) inherited from that resource's parent folder or container. In
either case, the Authorization statements are placed into separate WAC
documents called *Access Control List Resources* (or simply *ACLs*).

### Containers and Inherited ACLs

The WAC system assumes that web documents are placed in hierarchical containers
or folders. For convenience, users do not have to specify permissions on each
individual resource -- they can simply set permissions on a container, add a
[`acl:default`](#default-inherited-authorizations) predicate, and have all
of the resources in that container [inherit](#acl-inheritance-algorithm) those
permissions.

### Individual Resource ACLs

For fine-grained control, users can specify a set of permissions for each
individual resource (which overrides any permissions of its parent container).
See the [Example WAC Document](#example-wac-document) section to get an idea
for what that would look like.

### ACL Resource Location Discovery

Given a URL for an individual resource or container, a client can discover the
location of its corresponding ACL by performing a `HEAD` (or a `GET`) request
and parsing the `rel="acl"` link relation.

Example request to discover the location of the ACL resource for a web document
at `http://example.org/docs/file1` is given below:

```http
HEAD /docs/file1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Link: <file1.acl>; rel="acl"
```

The request to discover the location of a container's ACL resource looks
similar:

```http
HEAD /docs/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Link: <.acl>; rel="acl"
```

Note that the `acl` link relation uses relative path URLs (the absolute URL of
the ACL resource in the above example would be `/docs/.acl`).

Clients MUST NOT assume that the location of an ACL resource can be
deterministically derived from a document's URL. For example, given a document
with a URL of `/docs/file1`, clients cannot rely on the assumption that an ACL
resource exists at `/docs/file1.acl`, simply using `.acl` as a prefix. The
actual naming convention for ACL resources can differ for each individual
implementation (or even for each individual server). If one server locates the
ACL resource by appending the suffix `.acl`, another server could place the ACL
resources into a sub-container (locating it at `/docs/.acl/file1.acl` for the
example above).

## ACL Inheritance Algorithm

The following algorithm is used by servers to determine which ACL resources
(and hence which set of Authorization statements) apply to any given resource:

1. Use the document's own ACL resource if it exists (in which case, stop here).
2. Otherwise, look for authorizations to inherit from the ACL of the document's
  container. If those are found, stop here.
3. Failing that, check the container's *parent* container to see if *that* has
  its own ACL file, and see if there are any permissions to inherit.
4. Failing that, move up the container hierarchy until you find a container
  with an existing ACL file, which has some permissions to inherit.
5. The *root container* of a user's account MUST have an ACL resource specified.
  (If all else fails, the search stops there.)

It is considered an anti-pattern for a *client* to perform those steps, however.
A client may [discover](#acl-resource-location-discovery) and load a document's
individual resource (for example, for the purposes of editing its permissions).
If such a resource does not exist, a client SHOULD NOT search for, or interact
with, the inherited ACLs from an upstream container.

### ACL Inheritance Algorithm Example

*Note:* The server in the examples below is using the ACL naming convention of
appending `.acl` to resource URLs, for simplicity. As mentioned in the section
on [ACL discovery](#acl-resource-location-discovery), clients should not use
or assume any naming convention.

A request (to read or write) has arrived for a document located at
`/documents/papers/paper1`. The server does as follows:

1. First, it checks for the existence of an individual corresponding ACL
  resource. (That is, it checks if `paper1.acl` exists.) If this individual ACL
  resource exists, the server uses the Authorization statements in that ACL. No
  other statements apply.
2. If no individual ACL exists, the server next checks to see if the
  `/documents/papers/` container (in which the document resides) has its own
  ACL resource (here, `/documents/papers/.acl`). If it finds that, the server
  reads each authorization in the container's ACL, and if any of them contain an
  `acl:default` predicate, the server will use them (as if they were
  specified in `paper1.acl`). Again, if any such authorizations are found, the
  process stops there and no other statements apply.
3. If the document's container has no ACL resource of its own, the search
  continues upstream, in the *parent* container. The server would check if
  `/documents/.acl` exists, and then `/.acl`, until it finds some authorizations
  that contain `acl:default`.
4. Since the root container (here, `/`) MUST have its own ACL resource, the
  server would use the authorizations there as a last resort.

See the [Default (Inherited) Authorizations](#default-inherited-authorizations)
section below for an example of what a container's ACL resource might look like.

## Representation Format

The permissions in an ACL resource are stored in Linked Data format
([Turtle](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) by default, but also available in other
serializations).

*Note: A familiarity with Linked Data and
[RDF Concepts](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) helps with understanding
the terminology used in this spec.*

WAC uses the [`http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl`](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl)
ontology for its terms. Through the rest of the spec, the prefix `acl:` is
assumed to mean `@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#> .`

## Example WAC Document

Below is an example ACL resource that specifies that Alice (as identified by her
WebID `https://alice.databox.me/profile/card#me`) has full access (Read, Write
and Control) to one of her web resources, located at
`https://alice.databox.me/docs/file1`.

```ttl
# Contents of https://alice.databox.me/docs/file1.acl
@prefix  acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>  .

<#authorization1>
    a             acl:Authorization;
    acl:agent     <https://alice.databox.me/profile/card#me>;  # Alice's WebID
    acl:accessTo  <https://alice.databox.me/docs/file1>;
    acl:mode      acl:Read, 
                  acl:Write, 
                  acl:Control.
```

## Timestamps and temporal validity

Servers should provide timestamps indicating time of issue, last
modified and if possible, an estimate of future validity, to help
systems that manage authorizations. For this purpose, properties from
the
[Dublin Core metadata terms vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)
should be used: 
`dc:issued`, `dc:modified` and `dc:valid` with a valid `xsd:dateTime`
data type should be used, respectively.

For example, the below authorizes Alice to have read access to
a certain Web resource, and also says that the authorization is valid
5 years from last modification:

```ttl
@prefix  acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix  dc:   <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
@prefix  xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.

<#authorization2>
    a             acl:Authorization;
    dc:issued     "2013-09-11T07:18:19+0000"^^xsd:dateTime;
    dc:modified   "2019-02-12T16:15:15+0000"^^xsd:dateTime;
    dc:valid      "2024-02-12T16:15:15+0000"^^xsd:dateTime;
    acl:agent     <https://alice.databox.me/profile/card#me>;  # Alice's WebID
    acl:accessTo  <https://alice.databox.me/docs/file2>;
    acl:mode      acl:Read.
```

Specialised systems may use these RDF metadata statements to perform
relevant caching operations on individiual authorization resources.

While `dc:issued` and `dc:modified` can be set automatically, setting
`dc:valid` requires a commitment from the author of the authorization
that it will not change before the indicated time. Developers of
applications that provides ACL editing are encouraged to help users
set this sensibly.

Servers that evaluate authorizations to grant or deny access to
resources and uses an ACL cache, must ensure that the ACL cache uses a
current authorization even in the case that `dc:valid` has been set to
a future date.


### HTTP caching implementation

Systems should use these times if available to manage ACL caches. If
the HTTP protocol is used, `dc:modified` should be used for
[conditional requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232) and
`dc:valid` for [caching](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234). Note
that an ACL Resource may contain several
`acl:Authorization`s. Therefore, if used, the server must set the
`Last-Modified` header to the most recent `dc:modified`. Also, if the
server uses `dc:valid` to set the `Expires` header and/or to compute
`max-age`, it must use the `dc:valid` that is set to expire
first. Note that an ACL cache must be private.

This allows specialised clients or proxies to cache individual
authorizations based on the RDF metadata alone, and for legacy Web
caches to use cached copies of ACL Resources in their operations.

### Implementation notes

Applications may use cached authorizations to improve responsiveness
and usability. Since servers must always use the most recent
authorizations for operations, discrepancies between a client/proxy
cache and what the server uses may arise if an application uses a
stale authorization. That will not be security critical (since the the
server always uses the most recent authorization), but can result
in poor security usability. Developers should in particular be aware of
these two cases:

  1. A user has previously set a `dc:valid`, but the current user
     decides to modify the time and date even though the authorization
     previously given would still be valid. In this case, the user
     should be warned that some clients may not see the update, and
     so, it will be confusing to its users.
  1. Clients and proxies might use the timestamps to calculate heuristic
     freshness
     [(like suggested in the HTTP specification)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2).
     Like above, this may also result in that an expired authorization
     is provided to applications. Heuristic freshness should only be
     used with extreme care.

## Describing Agents

In WAC, we use the term *Agent* to identify *who* is allowed access to various
resources. In general, it is assumed to mean "someone or something that can
be referenced with a WebID", which covers users, groups (as well as companies
and organizations), and software agents such as applications or services.

### Singular Agent

An authorization may list any number of individual agents (that are being given
access) by using the `acl:agent` predicate, and using their WebID URIs as
objects. The example WAC document in a previous section grants access to Alice,
as denoted by her WebID URI, `https://alice.databox.me/profile/card#me`.

### Groups of Agents

To give access to a group of agents, use the `acl:agentGroup` predicate.
The object of an `agentGroup` statement is an instance of `vcard:Group`.
The WebIDs of group members are listed in it, using the
`vcard:hasMember` predicate. If a WebID is listed as member of that group,
it is given access.

Example ACL resource, `shared-file1.acl`, containing a group permission:

```ttl
# Contents of https://alice.databox.me/docs/shared-file1.acl
@prefix  acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.

# Individual authorization - Alice has Read/Write/Control access
<#authorization1>
    a             acl:Authorization;
    acl:accessTo  <https://alice.example.com/docs/shared-file1>;
    acl:mode      acl:Read,
                  acl:Write, 
                  acl:Control;
    acl:agent     <https://alice.example.com/profile/card#me>.

# Group authorization, giving Read/Write access to two groups, which are
# specified in the 'work-groups' document.
<#authorization2>
    a               acl:Authorization;
    acl:accessTo    <https://alice.example.com/docs/shared-file1>;
    acl:mode        acl:Read,
                    acl:Write;
    acl:agentGroup  <https://alice.example.com/work-groups#Accounting>;
    acl:agentGroup  <https://alice.example.com/work-groups#Management>.
```

Corresponding `work-groups` Group Listing document:

```ttl
# Contents of https://alice.example.com/work-groups
@prefix    acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix  vcard:  <http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#>.
@prefix     dc:  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
@prefix    xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.

<#Accounting>
    a                vcard:Group;
    vcard:hasUID     <urn:uuid:8831CBAD-1111-2222-8563-F0F4787E5398:ABGroup>;
    dc:issued        "2013-09-11T07:18:19+0000"^^xsd:dateTime;
    dc:modified      "2015-08-08T14:45:15+0000"^^xsd:dateTime;

    # Accounting group members:
    vcard:hasMember  <https://bob.example.com/profile/card#me>;
    vcard:hasMember  <https://candice.example.com/profile/card#me>.

<#Management>
    a                vcard:Group;
    vcard:hasUID     <urn:uuid:8831CBAD-3333-4444-8563-F0F4787E5398:ABGroup>;

    # Management group members:
    vcard:hasMember  <https://deb.example.com/profile/card#me>.
```

#### Group Listings - Implementation Notes

When implementing support for `acl:agentGroup` and Group Listings, keep in mind
the following issues:

1. Group Listings are regular documents (potentially each with its own `.acl`).
2. What authentication mechanism should the ACL checking engine use, when making
  requests for Group Listing documents on other servers?
3. Infinite request loops during ACL resolution become possible, if an `.acl`
  points to a group listing on a different server.
4. Therefore, for the moment, we suggest that all Group files which are used
  for group ACLs are public.

Possible future methods for a server to find out whether a given agent is a
member of s group are a matter for future research and possible addition here.

Group listings may also use timestamp predicates, and be cached along
with ACL resources.

### Public Access (All Agents)

To specify that you're giving a particular mode of access to *everyone*
(for example, that your WebID Profile is public-readable), you can use
`acl:agentClass foaf:Agent` to denote that you're giving access to the class
of *all* agents (the general public). For example:

```ttl
@prefix   acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix  foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.

<#authorization2>
    a               acl:Authorization;
    acl:agentClass  foaf:Agent;                               # everyone
    acl:mode        acl:Read;                                 # has Read-only access
    acl:accessTo    <https://alice.databox.me/profile/card>.  # to the public profile
```

### Authenticated Agents (Anyone logged on)

Authenticated access is a bit like public access
but it is not anonymous.   Access is only given to people
who have logged on and provided a specific ID.
This allows the server to track the people who have used the resource.

To specify that you're giving a particular mode of access to anyone *logged on*
(for example, that your collaborative page is open to anyone but you want to know who they are),
you can use
`acl:agentClass acl:AuthenticatedAgent` to denote that you're giving access to the class
of *all* authenticated agents. For example:

```ttl
@prefix   acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix  foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.

<#authorization2>
    a               acl:Authorization;
    acl:agentClass  acl:AuthenticatedAgent;                   # everyone
    acl:mode        acl:Read;                                 # has Read-only access
    acl:accessTo    <https://alice.databox.me/profile/card>.  # to the public profile
```

Note that this is a special case of `acl:agentClass` usage, since it doesn't
point to a Class Listing document that's meant to be de-referenced.

An application of this feature is to throw a resource open to all logged on users
for a specific amount of time, accumulate the list of those who case as a group,
and then later restrict access to that group, to prevent spam.

### Referring to Origins, i.e. Web Apps


When a compliant server receives a request from a web application running
in a browser, the browser will send an extra warning HTTP header, the Origin header.

```
Origin: https://scripts.example.com:8080
```
(For background, see also [Backgrounder on Same Origin Policy and CORS](https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/Background))
Note that the origin comprises the protocol and the DNS and port but none of the  path,
and no trailing slash.
All scripts running on the same origin are assumed to be run by the same
social entity, and so trusted to the same extent.

*When an Origin header is present then BOTH the authenticated agent AND
the origin MUST be allowed access*

 As both the user and the web app get to read or write (etc) the data, then they most BOTH
 be trusted.  This is the algorithm the server must go through.

 - If the requested mode is available to the public, then succeed `200 OK` with added CORS headers ACAO and ACAH **
 - If the user is *not* logged on, then fail `401 Unauthenticated`
 - Is the User authenticated is *not* allowed access required, AND the class AuthenticatedAgent is not allowed access, then fail `403 User Unauthorized`
 - If the Origin header is not present, the succeed `200 OK`
 - If the Origin is allowed by the ACL, then succeed `200 OK` with added CORS headers ACAO and ACAH
 - (In future proposed) Look up the owner's webid(s) to check for trusted apps declared there, and if match, succeed `200 OK` with added CORS headers ACAO and ACAH
 - Fail `403 Origin Unauthorized`

 Note it is a really good idea to make it clear both in the text of the status message and in the body of
 the message the difference between the user not being allowed and the web app they are using
 not being trusted.

 ** Possible future alternative:  Set ACAO header to `"*"` indicating that the document is public.  This will though block in the browser any access made using credentials.

#### Adding trusted web apps.

The authorization of trusted web app is a running battle between readers and writers on the web, and malevolent parties trying to break in to get unauthorized access.  The history or Cross-Site Scripting attacks and the introduction of the Same Origin Policy is not detailed here, The CORS specification in general prevents any web app from accessing any data from or associated with a different origin.  The web server can get around CORS. It is a pain to to do so, as it involves the server code echoing back the Origin header in the ACAO header, and also it must be done only when the web app in question actually is trustworthy.

In solid a maxim is, you have complete control of he data. Therefore it is up to the owner of the data, the publisher, the controller of the ACL, or more broadly the person running the solid server, to specify who gets access, be it people or apps.   However another maxim is that you can chose which app you use.  So of Alice publishes data, and Bob want to use his favorite app,  then how does that happen?  

##### Now:

 - The web server can run with a given trusted domain created by the solid developers.
 - A specific ACL can be be made to allow a given app to access a given file or folder of files.

##### Possible future:
- A writer could give in their profile a statement that they will allow readers to use a given app.

```
 <#me> acl:trustedApp [ acl:origin  <https://calendar.example.com>;
                        acl:mode    acl:Read, 
                                    acl:Append].
 <#me> acl:trustedApp [ acl:origin  <https://contacts.example.com>;
                        acl:mode    acl:Read, 
                                    acl:Write, 
                                    acl:Control].
```

We define the owners of the resource as people given explicit Control access to it.
(Possible future change: also anyone with Control access, even through a group, as the group can be used as a role)

For each owner x, the server looks up the (extended?) profile, and looks in it for a
triple of the form

```
?x  acl:trustedApp  ?y.
```
The set of trust objects is the accumulated set of ?y found in this way.

For the app ?z to have access, for every mode of access ?m required
there must be some trust object ?y such that
```
?y  acl:origin  ?z;
    acl:mode    ?m.
```
Note access to different modes may be given in the same or different trust objects.

## Referring to Resources

The `acl:accessTo` predicate specifies *which resources* you're giving access
to, using their URLs as the subjects.

### Referring to the ACL Resource Itself

Since an ACL resource is a plain Web document in itself, what controls who
has access to *it*? While an ACL resource *could* in theory have its own
corresponding ACL document (for example, `file1.acl` controls access to `file1`,
and `file1.acl.acl` could potentially control access to `file1.acl`), one
quickly realizes thats this recursion has to end somewhere.

Instead, the [`acl:Control` access mode](#aclcontrol) is used (see below), to
specify who has access to alter (or even view) the ACL resource.

## Modes of Access

The `acl:mode` predicate denotes a class of operations that the agents can
perform on a resource.

##### `acl:Read`
gives access to a class of operations that can be described as "Read
Access". In a typical REST API (such as the one used by
[Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec#https-rest-api)), this includes
access to HTTP verbs `GET`, and `HEAD`. This also includes any kind of
QUERY or SEARCH verbs, if supported.

##### `acl:Write`
gives access to a class of operations that can modify the resource. In a REST
API context, this would include `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` and `PATCH`. This also
includes the ability to perform SPARQL queries that perform updates, if those
are supported.

##### `acl:Append`
gives a more limited ability to write to a resource -- Append-Only. This
generally includes the HTTP verb `POST`, although some implementations may
also extend this mode to cover non-overwriting `PUT`s, as well as the
`INSERT`-only portion of SPARQL-based `PATCH`es. A typical example of Append
mode usage would be a user's Inbox -- other agents can write (append)
notifications to the inbox, but cannot alter or read existing ones.

##### `acl:Control`
is a special-case access mode that gives an agent the ability to *view and
modify the ACL of a resource*. Note that it doesn't automatically imply that the
agent has `acl:Read` or `acl:Write` access to the resource itself, just to its
corresponding ACL document. For example, a resource owner may disable their own
Write access (to prevent accidental over-writing of a resource by an app), but
be able to change their access levels at a later point (since they retain
`acl:Control` access).

## Default (Inherited) Authorizations

As previously mentioned, not every document needs its own individual ACL
resource and its own authorizations. Instead, one can can create an
Authorization for a container (in the container's own ACL resource), and then
use the `acl:default` predicate to denote that any resource within that
container will *inherit* that authorization. To put it another way, if an
Authorization contains `acl:default`, it will be applied *by default* to
any resource in that container.

You can override the default inherited authorization for any resource by
creating an individual ACL just for that resource.

An example ACL for a container would look something like:

```ttl
# Contents of https://alice.databox.me/docs/.acl
@prefix  acl:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.

<#authorization1>
    a                  acl:Authorization;

    # These statements specify access rules for the /docs/ container itself:
    acl:agent          <https://alice.databox.me/profile/card#me>;
    acl:accessTo       <https://alice.databox.me/docs/>;
    acl:mode           acl:Read, 
                       acl:Write, 
                       acl:Control;

    # default says: this authorization (the statements above) 
    #   will also be inherited by any resource within that container 
    #   that doesn't have its own ACL.
    acl:default  <https://alice.databox.me/docs/>.
```

## Old discussion of access to group files

##### Group Listings - Authentication of External Requests

*This section is not normative*

Group Listings via `acl:agentGroup` links introduce the possibility of an ACL
checking engine having to make requests to other servers. Given that access to
those external group listings can be protected, the question immediately arises:
By what mechanism should the ACL checking engine authenticate its request to
external servers?

For example: Alice sends a GET request to a resource on the server
`https://a.com`. The ACL for that resource links to a group listing on an
external server, `https://b.com`. In the process of resolving the ACL, `a.com`
must send a request to `b.com`, to get that group listing. Note that it's not
Alice herself (or her application) that is sending that request, it's actually
`a.com` sending it (as part of trying to resolve its own ACL). How should
`a.com` authenticate itself? Does it have its own credentials, or does it have
a way to say that it's acting on behalf of Alice? Or both?

There are several implementation possibilities:

**No authentication**. The ACL checking engine sends *un-authenticated* requests
to external servers (to fetch group listings). This is the simplest method to
implement, but suffers from the limitation that those external group listings
need to be public-readable. THIS IS THE ONLY METHOD CURRENTLY IN USE

**WebID-TLS Delegation**. If your implementation uses the WebID-TLS
authentication method, it also needs to implement the ability to delegate its
requests on behalf of the original user.
(No, the original requester may not be allowed access -- you don't have to able to
access a group to be in it)
For a discussion of such a capability,
see the [Extending the WebID Protocol with Access
Delegation](http://bblfish.net/tmp/2012/08/05/WebID_Delegation.pdf) paper.
One thing to keep in mind is - if there are several hops (an ACL request chain
across more than one other domain), how does this change the delegation
confirmation algorithm? If the original server is explicitly authorized for
delegation by the user, what about the subsequent ones?

**ID Tokens/Bearer Tokens**. If you're using a token-based authentication system
such as OpenID Connect or OAuth2 Bearer Tokens, it will also need to implement
the ability to delegate its ACL requests on behalf of the original user. See
[PoP/RFC7800](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7800) and [Authorization Cross
Domain Code](http://openid.bitbucket.org/draft-acdc-01.html) specs for relevant
examples.

##### Infinite Request Loops in Group Listings

Since Group Listings (which are linked to from ACL resources using
the `acl:agentGroup` predicate) reside in regular documents, those documents
will have their very own `.acl` resources that restrict which users (or groups)
are allowed to access or change them. This fact, that `.acl`s point to Group
Listings, which can have `.acl`s of their own, which can potentially also point
to Group Listings, and so on, introduces the potential for infinite loops
during ACL resolution.

Take the following situation with two different servers:

```
https://a.com                     https://b.com
-------------        GET          ---------------
group-listA        <------        group-listB.acl
    |                                  ^     contains:
    |                                  |     agentGroup <a.com/group-ListA>   
    v                GET               |
group-listA.acl    ------>        group-listB
  contains:
  agentGroup <b.com/group-listB>
```

The access to `group-listA` is controlled by `group-listA.acl`. So far so good.
But if `group-listA.acl` contains any `acl:agentGroup` references to *another*
group listing (say, points to `group-listB`), one runs into potential danger.
In order to retrieve that other group listing, the ACL-checking engine on
`https://b.com` will need to check the rules in `group-listB.acl`. And if
`group-listB.acl` (by accident or malice) points back to `group-listA` a request
will be made to access `group-listA` on the original server `https://a.com`,
which would start an infinite cycle.

To guard against these loops, implementers have several options:

**A) Do not allow cross-domain Group Listing resolutions**.
The simplest to implement (but also the most limited) option is to disallow
cross-domain Group Listings resolution requests. That is, the ACL-checking code
could detect `agentGroup` links pointing to external servers during ACL
resolution time, and treat those uniformly (as errors, or as automatic "access
denied").

**B) Treat Group Listings as special cases**.
This assumes that the server has the ability to parse or query the contents of a
Group Listing document *before* resolving ACL checks -- a design decision that
some implementations may find unworkable. If the ACL checking engine can inspect
the contents of a document and know that it's a Group Listing, it can put in
various safeguards against loops. For example, it could validate ACLs when they
are created, and disallow external Group Listing links, similar to option A
above. Note that even if you wanted to ensure that no `.acl`s are allowed for
Group Listings, and that all such documents would be public-readable, you would
still have to be able to tell Group Listings apart from other documents, which
would imply special-case treatment.

**C) Create and pass along a tracking/state parameter**.
For each ACL check request beyond the original server, it would be possible to
create a nonce-type tracking parameter and pass it along with each subsequent
request. Servers would then be able to use this parameter to detect loops on
each particular request chain. However, this is a spec-level solution (instead
of an individual implementation level), since all implementations have to play
along for this to work. See issue
[solid/solid#8](https://github.com/solid/solid/issues/8) for further
discussion).

**D) Ignore this issue and rely on timeouts.**
It's worth noting that if an infinite group ACL loop was created by mistake,
this will soon become apparent since requests for that resource will time out.
If the loop was created by malicious actors, this is comparable to a very
small, low volume DDOS attack, which experienced server operators know how to
guard against. In either case, the consequences are not disastrous.


### Other ideas about specifying trusted apps

 - A reader can ask to use a given app, by publishing the fact that she trusts a given app.

 ```
 <#me> acl:trustsForUse [ acl:origin  <https://calendar.example.com>;
                          acl:mode    acl:Read, 
                                      acl:Append].
 <#me> acl:trustsForUse [ acl:origin  <https://contacts.example.com>; 
                          acl:mode    acl:Read, 
                                      acl:Write, 
                                      acl:Control].
 ```

A writer could have also more sophisticated requirements, such as that any app Alice
wants to use must be signed by developer from a given list, and so on.

Therefore, by pulling the profiles of the reader and/or the writer, and/or the Origin app itself,
the system can be adjusted to allow new apps to be added without bad things happening


## Not Supported by Design

This section describes some features or acl-related terms that are not included
in this spec by design.

##### Resource Owners
WAC has no formal notion of a resource owner, and no explicit Owner access mode.
For convenience/UI purposes, it may be assumed that Owners are agents that have
Read, Write and Control permissions.

##### acl:accessToClass
The predicate `acl:accessToClass` is not supported.

##### Regular Expressions
The use of regular expressions in statements such as `acl:agentClass` is not
supported.
